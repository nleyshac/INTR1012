	<p>Movement - whether it is working out at home, going on a run, or even walking around the house, 
	has provided me with a big mental boost. </p>

	<li class="italicize">Maintaining a routine </li>
	<p>As mundane as it may sound, creating structure in the day has increased my mood, productivity,

	<li class="italicize">Connecting with others (at a distance of course)</li>
	<p>Chatting with friends through collaboration platforms like zoom or playing online games together 
	has been a fun way to stay connected.</p>
